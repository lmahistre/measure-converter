# Hexconverter

## Usage

This addon instantly converts numbers from and to different formats : decimal, binary, octal, hexadecimal and base 256.

If the hexadecimal value corresponds to a color, the corresponding color is displayed in RGB decimal format, and an indicator displays a preview of the color. If it corresponds to a HTML color, its name is displayed.

It is possible to display the converter in a separate window to avoid losing converted data.

## Build and development

The Javascript of the addon is built using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) and [React](https://reactjs.org).

Source files for Javascript and CSS are in the folder `src`. 
Files generated by build are in the two folders:
* `addon` contains the files for the Firefox addon
* `public` contains the files to use the app as a web page
There are 2 generated files: `hexc.js` and `hexc.css`. Other files are static.

First, install dependencies:

`npm install`

To compile Javascript and CSS files for the web page:

`npm run dev`

To launch unit tests:

`npm test`

To build Javascript and CSS files for production (addon and site), then launch unit tests:

`npm run build`

To create Zip files containing the addon code and source code:

`npm run publish`

The package for the addon is made from folder `addon`, which contains static files, manifest and html.
